            <h2><i>Childhood Years</i></h2>
            <p>
                <i>Here’s my childhood story. I loved playing outside with my childhood friends. We played Chinese garter, piko, tagu-taguan, and many other Filipino games. It was always fun, and we never got tired of running around. We laughed, shouted, and competed with each other every day. No matter how hot or rainy it was, we always found a way to play.</i><sup>1</sup>  
                <i>I still remember when it was getting darker outside, it would be time to go home. But I never wanted to stop playing. Every evening, my lolo would come looking for me. He would call me angrily, “Uwi na, Kababae mong tao, nasa labas ka pa!”</i><sup>2</sup>  
                <i>The moment I saw him, I would quickly run back home. At that time, I felt mad whenever I was forced to stop playing. I thought it was unfair that I had to go home while my friends could still play. I would stomp my feet and pout, wishing I could stay outside longer.</i><sup>3</sup>  
                <i>But now that I’m grown up, I understand why my lolo was so strict. He was only protecting me and making sure I was safe.</i><sup>4</sup>  
                <i>Looking back, those childhood moments make me smile. I miss the days when life was simple, and all I cared about was playing. The friendships I made during those years were priceless. Those memories will always stay with me. Even though I didn’t realize it back then, my childhood was truly a happy one.</i><sup>5</sup>
            </p>

            <h2><i>Teenage Years</i></h2>
            <p>
                <<i>When I was in my teenage years, around 7th to 10th grade, my classmates and I would hang out together after school. We would go to KTVs or the mall, just to play in the arcades, because we had free time to do whatever we wanted.</i><sup>1</sup>  
                <i>After playing, we would go out to eat and enjoy each other’s company. Those were some of the best moments of my teenage years. We had so much fun.</i><sup>2</sup>  
                <i>My teenage years were also filled with school competitions, such as dancing and role-playing. I was very outgoing back then, never shy to join any activity. I loved being involved in everything, whether it was dancing, acting, or just having fun with friends.</i><sup>3</sup>  
                <i>Now, I can’t imagine doing those things anymore. My confidence during my teenage years was something I took for granted, but now I feel different.</i><sup>4</sup>  
                <i>I also joined the varsity badminton team in high school. We competed in intramurals, playing against different schools. I participated in both singles and doubles events.</i><sup>5</sup>  
                <i>Sometimes we won gold, sometimes silver, and those wins made me proud. I worked hard with my teammates, and the experiences taught me a lot about teamwork.</i><sup>6</sup>  
                <i>Looking back, I miss the energy and excitement of those days. I miss the competitions, the fun with friends, and the freedom to do whatever I wanted. Now, I feel like I can’t do the same things I used to do.</i><sup>7</sup>  
                <i>My teenage years were full of unforgettable moments that I will always remember. I learned a lot during those years, and they shaped the person I am today. Though I can’t go back to those times, I cherish those memories and the lessons I learned.</i><sup>8</sup>  
            </p>

            <h2><i>College Years</i></h2>
            <p>
                <i>Now that I am in college, my first year was hard. I had trouble adjusting to the new setup. Sometimes I felt overwhelmed and wondered if I was doing things right. I often questioned if I chose the right course. There were times when I had breakdowns because of the pressure. It was difficult at first, but it has become a bit easier.</i><sup>1</sup>  
                <i>I met some classmates who became my support system. They helped me whenever I needed it. I also learned how to manage my time better. I now know how to balance schoolwork and free time.</i><sup>2</sup>  
                <i>College is different from high school, and I can’t do the same things I used to. I also miss going to arcades with friends, but I still try. I’ve learned how to organize my time so I don’t get too stressed.</i><sup>3</sup>  
                <i>I try to stay focused on my studies and make time for fun. Being in college has taught me a lot. It’s not easy, but I’m learning how to handle it.</i><sup>4</sup>  
                <i>I still sometimes feel pressure, but I know how to deal with it now. I’ve grown a lot since I started college. Even though it’s tough, I know I’m getting better at it.</i><sup>5</sup>
