            <i>Here’s my childhood story. I loved playing outside with my childhood friends.</i><sup>1</sup>
            <i>We played Chinese garter, piko, tagu-taguan, and many other Filipino games.</i><sup>2</sup>
            <i>It was always fun, and we never got tired of running around. We laughed, shouted, and competed with each other every day.</i><sup>3</sup>
            <i>No matter how hot or rainy it was, we always found a way to play.</i><sup>4</sup>
            <i>I still remember when it was getting darker outside, it would be time to go home.</i><sup>5</sup>
            <i>But I never wanted to stop playing. Every evening, my lolo would come looking for me.</i><sup>6</sup>
            <i>He would call me angrily, “Uwi na, Kababae mong tao, nasa labas ka pa!”</i><sup>7</sup>
            <i>The moment I saw him, I would quickly run back home.</i><sup>8</sup>
            <i>At that time, I felt mad whenever I was forced to stop playing.</i><sup>9</sup>
            <i>I thought it was unfair that I had to go home while my friends could still play.</i><sup>10</sup>
            <i>I would stomp my feet and pout, wishing I could stay outside longer.</i><sup>11</sup>
            <i>But now that I am grown up, I understand why my lolo was so strict.</i><sup>12</sup>
            <i>He was only protecting me and making sure I was safe.</i><sup>13</sup>
            <i>Looking back, those childhood moments make me smile.</i><sup>14</sup>
            <i>I miss the days when life was simple, and all I cared about was playing.</i><sup>15</sup>
            <i>The friendships I made during those years were priceless.</i><sup>16</sup>
            <i>Those memories will always stay with me. Even though I didn’t realize it back then, my childhood was truly a happy one.</i><sup>17</sup>
