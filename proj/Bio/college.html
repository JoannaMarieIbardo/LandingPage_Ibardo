            <i>Now that I am in college, my first year was hard. I had trouble adjusting to the new setup.</i><sup>1</sup>
        <i>Sometimes I felt overwhelmed and wondered if I was doing things right. I often questioned if I chose the right course.</i><sup>2</sup>
        <i>There were times when I had breakdowns because of the pressure. It was difficult at first, but it has become a bit easier.</i><sup>3</sup>
        <i>I met some classmates who became my support system. They helped me whenever I needed it.</i><sup>4</sup>
        <i>I also learned how to manage my time better. I now know how to balance schoolwork and free time.</i><sup>5</sup>
        <i>College is different from high school, and I can’t do the same things I used to. I also miss going to arcades with friends, but I still try.</i><sup>6</sup>
        <i>I’ve learned how to organize my time so I don’t get too stressed. I try to stay focused on my studies and make time for fun.</i><sup>7</sup>
        <i>Being in college has taught me a lot. It’s not easy, but I’m learning how to handle it.</i><sup>8</sup>
        <i>I still sometimes feel pressure, but I know how to deal with it now. I’ve grown a lot since I started college.</i><sup>9</sup>
        <i>Even though it’s tough, I know I’m getting better at it.</i><sup>10</sup>
