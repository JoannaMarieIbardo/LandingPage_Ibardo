            <i>When I was in my teenage years, around 7th to 10th grade, my classmates and I would hang out together after school.</i><sup>1</sup>  
            <i>We would go to KTVs or the mall, just to play in the arcades, because we had free time to do whatever we wanted.</i><sup>2</sup>  
            <i>After playing, we would go out to eat and enjoy each other’s company. Those were some of the best moments of my teenage years.</i><sup>3</sup>  
            <i>We had so much fun, My teenage years were also filled with school competitions, such as dancing and role-playing.</i><sup>4</sup>  
            <i>I was very outgoing back then, never shy to join any activity. I loved being involved in everything, whether it was dancing, acting, or just having fun with friends.</i><sup>5</sup>  
            <i>Now, I can’t imagine doing those things anymore. My confidence during my teenage years was something I took for granted, but now I feel different.</i><sup>6</sup>  
            <i>I also joined the varsity badminton team in high school. We competed in intramurals, playing against different schools. I participated in both singles and doubles events.</i><sup>7</sup>  
            <i>Sometimes we won gold, sometimes silver, and those wins made me proud. I worked hard with my teammates, and the experiences taught me a lot about teamwork.</i><sup>8</sup>  
            <i>Looking back, I miss the energy and excitement of those days. I miss the competitions, the fun with friends, and the freedom to do whatever I wanted.</i><sup>9</sup>  
            <i>Now, I feel like I can’t do the same things I used to do. My teenage years were full of unforgettable moments that I will always remember.</i><sup>10</sup>  
            <i>I learned a lot during those years, and they shaped the person I am today. Though I can’t go back to those times, I cherish those memories and the lessons I learned.</i><sup>11</sup>
